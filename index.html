    <p><h2 id="Tree">In the small town of Alderwood, there was a shop with no sign above its door.</h2> Everyone knew it as The Clockmaker's Garden, even though it sold no flowers. The windows were always fogged, and faint ticking sounds escped through the cracks. Some people said the clocks inside could tell more than time. They could whisper secrets if you listened carefully enough.
        <p> Vickie had walked past the shop hundreds of times, always curious but never brave enough to enter. One rainy afternoon, when her umbrella flipped inside out and the wind chased her down the street, she finally pushed the door open.</p>
        <p>The air smelled of pinewood and something sweet, like honey warming a stove. Rows of clocks lined the walls. Tall grandfather clocks with carved moons, pocket watches suspended from thin wires, and tiny glass globes that pulsed like fireflies. Behind the counter stood a man with silver hair tied back in a ribbon. His eyes were bright and patient, like someone had been waiting a long time.</p>
        <p>"Welcome", he said. "What kind of time are you looking for?"</p>
        <p>Vickie blinked. "I just wanted to look."</p>
        <p>"Looking is a kind of search," the man replied. "Maybe you'll find the hour you need."</p>
        <p>He invited her deeper into the shop. Every clock ticked in its own rythm, some fast, some slow. Yet together they created a gentle harmony, like distant rain. In the back corner, Vickie noticed a small wooden clock shaped like a seedling. Its hands move backward.</p>
        <p>"What's this one?" she asked.</p>
        <p>The clockmaker's smile softened. "That is the Garden Clock. It grows memories instead of flowers."</p>
        <p>Vickie frowned. "How can a clock grow memories?"</p>
        <p>"Time is soil," he said. "Memories are the seeds. Wind them carefully, and you may revisit moments you thought were gone."</p>
        <p>He lifted the clock and handed it to her. The wood felt warm, almost alive. "Turn the key once, and you'll return to an hour you've lost. But be gentle. Time dislikes rough handling."</p>
        <p>Vickie thought of the afternoon her best friend Salma had moved away last year. She had wanted to say something brave like <i>don[t forget me</i> but the words had tangled in her throat. Maybe this clock coulc give her another chance.</p>
        <p>"How much is it?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"For you," the clockmaker said, "only a promise."</p>
        <p>"A promise?"</p>
        <p>"That you will plant something real after you return. A seed, a tree, a friendship, anything that grows foreard."</p>
        <p>Vickie nodded. She tucked the clock into her backpack and hurried home. That night, when the house was quiet, she wound the key. The hands spun backward, faster and faster, until the room blurred like watercolor in the rain.</p>
        <p>When the world settled, she stood again at the train station a year ago. Salma was there, suitcase in hand, her face half hidden by a scarf. The loudspeaker announced the final boarding call. Vickie's heart pounded. She stepped forward.</p>
        <p>"Salma!" she called. Her voice didn't tremble this time. "I'm going to miss you so much.</p>
        <p>Salma's eyes brightened. "I will. And you have to tell me everything about Alderwood. Promise?"</p>
        <p>"Promise," Vickie said.</p>
        <p>They hugged. Then the train doors closed, and Salma was gone. The scene faded like morning fog, and Vickie found herself back in her bedroom. The clock lay silent on her desk, its key still</p>
        <p>Outside, the rain had stopped. The moonlight glowed silver on the garden behind her house. Vickie grabbed a small trowl and went outside. She dug a hole and planted a packet of wildflower seeds her grandmother had given her months ago. As she covered them with soil, she wispered, "Grow forward."</p>
        <p> The next morning, Vickie returned to the shop to thank the clockmaker, but the door was locked and the windows were clear. Inside, there were no clocks, only a single pot of blooming wildflowerrs, swaying gently as if they were keeping time.</p>
        <p>Vickie smiled. Some hours, she realized, don't need to be measured. They just need to be planted</p>
